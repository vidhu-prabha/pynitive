#Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
#Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.
#number1 = 20 number2 = 30 The result is 600
#number1 = 40  number2 = 30 The result is 70
num1 = 40
num2 = 70
print(num1* num2 if num1 * num2 <= 1000 else num1 + num2)
